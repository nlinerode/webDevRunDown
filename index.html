		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Alright so I'll try to make this fairly cohesive.</p>

		<p>There are tons and tons of resources and I feel like I spent the first year of learning this stuff for almost no reason. I mean, I learned a lot of basics from my first year or so learning and they've helped a lot. I just wish I would've had more guidance when I started, so here's what I can do to help.</p>

		<p>To start everything off the right way for you, here is a wonderful video to watch.
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnwsG9a5riA">Well this one is just an intro this guy's channel</a></p>
		<p>But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hDKfBKuXjI">here is the video that put me on track this year.</a></p>

		<p>This video gave me great insight into what to do and what to learn first etc. So watch this for an overview into web dev.</p>
	</div>

	<!-- HTML Book -->
	<div id="htmlBook">
	<h2>Books (Well just one...)</h2>
		<p>Next, I'll put a very simple book here.<p>
		<p><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1495157933&sr=8-1&keywords=html+book">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a></em><p>


		<p>This book was designed for beginners and hobbyists, but I read through it in a month (shocker right?) and it helped solidify what I already knew a LOT. It has lots of good knowledge to get you going on the basics of web development. There is also a Javascript book by the same guy, but I haven't really gotten into yet (it's much more complicated).
		It's not too expensive, (maybe even at the library) and it's a pretty comprehensive starter guide.</p>

		<p>I have more books I recently got but haven't read yet, so that's the only book I can recommend so far.</p>

<!-- Site Lists -->

	<div id="siteList">
	<h2>The elders of the Internet know my name!</h2>
	<p>Back to the web!</p>
	<p>There are MANY many learning sites. Some are paid, subscription, and free. I'm cheap of course so I find the best free ones I can. </p>
		<p>Ok I'll start a list here.</p>
		<ol>
			<li> 
				<h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA">Traversy Media</a> </h4>
					<p>Since I already showed you his video, Traversy Media has some great content on his channel on Youtube. Absolutely wonderful. It's pretty fast paced, but it's chock full of good stuff.</p>
					
					<p>He has a video on creating a responsive web page (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw&t=2167s) which turned my existing knowledge (and from the book above) into a working exercise. It was greatly helpful into helping utilize my skills.<p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h4><a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a></h4>
					<p>So I stumbled on this a few months ago. Didn't take to it right away, but then I fell in love with it. Got hooked. It's basic, but you get to code right away and do lots and lots of trial and error.</p>
					<p>The downside,(upside maybe?) is that it isn't very "teachy". As in, you'll have to research how to do pretty much every exercise and challenge that you find. But as you study more web dev, you'll realize quickly that there is no complete answer guide to anything. You'll have to find it yourself.</p>
					<p>But, it is cool. You make real projects and a portfolio for yourself. You learn a bit along the way, through the site and through self-teaching and research.</p>
					<p>You also have to set up a GitHub account which is handy and helpful. Last weekend I learned how to properly use it and it's awesome.</p>
					<p>Also, you can network! Through it I've found a group of people in Charlotte that are starting to meet up weekly. It's a necessity to coding and I'm sure there's something up that way too.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h4><a href="http://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a></h4>
				<p>I just recently started using this site. There were a bunch of free courses on here and I snagged them.</p>
				<p>However! There is one course in particular that I picked up on sale. I guess it goes on sale for $10-$20 very often, so you should be able to get it. He's a great teacher and it's very well explained. I wish I would've found it sooner as many others have said.</p> 
				<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview">Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp"</a></p>
				<p>Definitely look into that and keep an eye on it. It's worth getting.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h4><a href="http://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a></h4>
				<p>So W3C is the standard and the people who define HTML and all the goodness there. This is their learning, hands-on site. I've heard people talk smack about it, but I love it. I taught myself Bootstrap just by going through their tutorial on it. I also am going through CSS3 on the site too. It's a great reference if anything.</p>
				<p>I do recommend it highly though. It's pretty straighforward, lots of reference material, and lots of examples you can see, and even edit on the site. That way, you can experiment and play with it.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h4><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a></h4>
				<p>Mozilla Developer Network. I just recently found this (through the bootcamp course above I just mentioned) and have been using it since. It's a great comprehensive site with lots of details. It pretty much as all the web standards on it and examples etc.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<h4><a href="https://developers.google.com/training/web/">Google Web Devs</a></h4>
				<p>Can't say much about this one because I haven't really used it, but they do offer some free courses through it.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h4><a href="http://www.htmldog.com/">HTML Dog</a></h4>
				<p>Another one I haven't used, but I've heard good about. Similar to W3Schools if I'm correct.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h4>Others</h4>
				<p>There is a plethora of others, and I'm sure I can send you more. They're out there. There are others like Treehouse and CodeAcademy that are popular but paid courses.</p>
			</li>

<!-- Text editors -->
	<div id="text-editors">
		<h2>Text Editors!</h2>
		<p>Almost forgot! Text editors.</p>
		<p>So you can use Notepad (or whatever Linux's equivalent is). I'm actually not sure what Linux has, but <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a> is great. It's quite nice and it's techincally free to use forever. (I'll pay for it eventually). A good text-editor will help coding when you start. Notepad is nice to get the feel for syntax and muscle memory and general memorization. Then work into an IDE, more formal text editor.</p>

	<h2>In closing...</h2>
		<p>I'm sure there's more to tell you, but it all gets nitty-gritty and like a bajillion sites I have bookmarked right now (seriously now though...gotta be a hundred or more of just web dev stuff).</p>
		<p>If you have any questions on where to start, just ask.</p>
